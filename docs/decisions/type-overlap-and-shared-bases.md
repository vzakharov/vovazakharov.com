# Type Overlap & Shared Bases

**Every member two named types both declare has exactly one home — a shared base type they
both intersect. Enforced at threshold 1 by `pnpm type-overlap`, in `vet`.**

_Adopted wholesale from `Playgramai/playgramapp`, where the detector was ratcheted 4→3→2→1 over
several batches before landing globally at 1. This repo starts at 1: it was clean at that floor on
adoption bar one pair, so there is nothing to phase in. The upstream doc
(`docs/decisions/type-overlap-and-shared-bases.md` there) carries the empirical record — the counts,
the fifty-five numbered lessons, and the FSD-specific placement rules this one drops._

---

## 1. Why even a single shared member gets its own base

`pnpm type-overlap` compares every pair of named type aliases in the repo and fails the run when the
two declare any member with identical text. Nothing is grandfathered: a run is either clean or names
the pair to fix. Three returns pay for that floor.

**It prevents drift.** Two declarations of one shape are two things to change, and TypeScript won't
catch a divergence, because each duplicate redeclared its own fields. The floor is the member-level
half of CLAUDE.md's "derive types from the source of truth" rule: that rule covers a shape tracking
_another declaration_, this one a shape tracking _nothing but a sibling's copy of itself_.

**It makes future refactoring mechanical.** A member with exactly one home is a seam. Branding
`localeCode` into `Branded<string, 'Locale'>` becomes one edit at the base rather than a sweep over
every spelling, and "which types carry a title?" becomes find-references rather than a grep that
misses `title?`, `title: string | null` and every inline literal.

**It surfaces bad data structures.** A reported group is frequently _not_ a missing base. It is:

- a **key lying about its meaning** — `file` for a path in a script and a `File` in the app;
  `owner` for a repo owner and a person; `onRefresh` for a data re-fetch and a `location.reload()`;
- a **stem drifting under two spellings** — `isActive`/`active`, `isLoading`/`loading`;
- an **optional with no reason to be optional**, forcing double-negative reads
  (`disabled: enabled === false`) on every reader;
- a **one-field type whose name is worse than the base's**.

The tool can't tell you which; it makes you look. The fix is a rename or a collapse rather than an
extraction often enough that a **rename pass** and an **optionality audit** are standing steps (§6).

### The coincidence objection

Single-member overlaps on `id: string` or `children: ReactNode` look like coincidence rather than
duplication, so the objection to a floor of 1 is that it flags virtually every pair. Upstream it
didn't: 248 groups at threshold 1, all cleared, none forcing an abstraction that reads as invented —
and category three above is only reachable at 1, every lying key and drifted stem there having
shared exactly one member. A base over a recurring primitive costs one intersection and buys the
seam. What it does not buy is coverage the detector's syntax can't see (§8).

## 2. The mechanism

`scripts/type-overlap-check.ts`, wired into `scripts/vet.sh`. Nothing runs on pull requests here
(see CLAUDE.md → Deployment), so the vet run is the only place the gate fires — which makes
`/finalize` the point at which a branch is actually held to it.

Only a type's _own_ members count — the named constituents of an intersection are inherited — which
is exactly why `& Base` on both types makes a finding disappear. Two members are "the same" when
their normalized signature text (name, modifiers, type annotation, whitespace-collapsed) is
identical, so `title?` ≠ `title` and `path: string | undefined` ≠ `path?: string` — a pair that is
materially different as a contract too (§3), not merely as text. Findings group by identical shared
member set, so one extraction clears a whole group, and a type sharing _different_ sets with
different partners needs a base for each.

**Threshold 1 is the floor.** `TYPE_OVERLAP_MIN` overrides it upward only, so it can triage a looser
run but never preview a stricter one.

**The scan covers the whole repo** minus dot-directories, dependencies, build output, `public/` and
`tmp/`. A skip-list rather than upstream's root allowlist, because the failure modes are not
symmetric: an allowlist silently un-scans the next source directory someone adds, where a skip-list
at worst scans one holding no type aliases.

**Only `type` aliases are scanned.** `@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-definitions` bans
`interface` repo-wide, and that ban is what makes the scope complete rather than a subset — without
it the gate is blind to every named shape someone happens to spell as an interface. The two land
together; neither is worth much alone.

## 3. Naming families

The sole home for the families. The table is the at-the-keyboard reference; the rules below hold what
a table can't. `lib/typings.ts` is the repo-wide catalog, and the seeded bases (`Named`, `WithId`,
`WithFilePath`, `Titled`, `Described`) are the families in miniature.

| Member kind         | Required                                                          | `?:`                                  | `\| undefined`, required key | `\| null`              | may be both         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| descriptive scalar  | `Named`, `Titled`, `Labeled`, `Described`, `Keyed`, `Timestamped` | `Maybe<Participle>`                   | —                            | `Nullably<Participle>` | —                   |
| noun / value / node | `With<Noun>`                                                      | `WithOptional<Noun>`                  | `WithUndefinable<Noun>`      | `WithNullable<Noun>`   | `WithNilable<Noun>` |
| id pointer          | `<Entity>Ref`                                                     | `OptionalPostRef`                     | `UndefinablePostRef`         | `NullablePostRef`      | —                   |
| boolean flag        | `Whether<Flag>`                                                   | `Maybe<Flag>`                         | —                            | —                      | —                   |
| callback            | `-able` / `Handles<Event>` / `Can<Verb…>`                         | `Maybe<Able>` / `MaybeHandles<Event>` | —                            | —                      | —                   |

`With` is the single "carries a thing" prefix — never `Has`. Coin participles freely where one reads
well (`Keyed`, `Timestamped`, `Described`); short and intuitive beats grammatically strict.
`WithNilable<Noun>` covers the doubly-loose forms, both `?: T | null` and a required
`T | null | undefined`.

**Booleans have two axes and each gets its own word.** Whether the _value_ holds →
`Whether<Flag>`; whether the _key_ is present → `Maybe<Flag>`, the same sense `Maybe` carries for
participles. `<Flag>` is the key in PascalCase with a leading `is` dropped. `Whether…` names the
_question_ where `Archived` would assert the property, and "Whether X" is grammatical for any
predicate, so the rule needs no per-field tiebreaks (`WhetherCanEdit`, `WhetherAtLimit`).

**Callbacks are named for who acts on what** — the distinction the `on` prefix erases, which is why
spelling can't drive the rule. Three rules, no residual:

1. the owner acts on the type's own subject → `-able` (`onClose` → `Closable`; `?:` →
   `Maybe<Able>`). Mechanically an `on<Verb>` key whose verb takes no object beyond the subject;
2. the subject reports something happened → `Handles<Event>` (`onSaved` → `HandlesSaved`; `?:` →
   `MaybeHandles<Event>`). Mechanically an `on<Participle>` key, or an `on<Noun>` key carrying a
   payload;
3. the holder is handed a capability to act on something else → `Can<Verb…>` (`abort` →
   `CanAbort`). Mechanically a bare-verb key, or an `on<Verb><Object>` key whose object is not the
   subject.

**Reading is an action**, so a getter (`getScrollContainer`) is rule 3, not a thing carried — which
leaves `With<Noun>` meaning only what it always meant and never straddling the callbacks.

**`<Entity>Ref` is the id-pointer family**: a base that _addresses_ an entity rather than carrying
it, so its member is the id key — a `PostRef` is `{ postId: string }`, never a post. That is the
whole distinction from `With<Noun>`, and it is why a ref names the entity, not the key.

**A `Ref` carries its modifier in front** — `OptionalPostRef`, `NullablyTitledPostRef`, and
`Optional…` rather than `Maybe…` because `Maybe` reads well only before an adjective while `Ref` is
a noun. A ref carrying its modifier as a trailing noun (`PostTitleRef`) is the smell.

**A true type-collision on one key** takes distinct `With<Type><Noun>` names — `WithStringValue`
beside `WithNumericValue`, `WithStringStatus` beside a domain-enum status.

**Qualified vs bare key of one value type** — one value type reached under two key spellings:
`postType: PostType` (qualified — the type name camelCased in full) beside `type: PostType` (bare —
the leading qualifier supplied by the enclosing type). The qualified key keeps the plain
`With<Type>` name and the bare key takes `WithBare<Type>`: `WithPostType` and `WithBarePostType`.
Both names are built from the **value type**, never from the key, so `Bare` is the only thing
telling them apart.

That marker names a distinction, so it is only correct where one exists: mark the bare side, and
only when _both_ spellings are based. A based member has exactly one declarer, so the test is
whether each spelling has a base, not how many types declare it — a lone `{ type: WugType }` with no
`{ wugType: WugType }` anywhere is `WithWugType`.

_Authoring guidance for new code_: reach for the **qualified** key when the member travels — across
modules, into a payload — and the **bare** key when the enclosing type already names the domain.

**A key frozen by an external vocabulary** gets a type alias rather than a rename:
`StringFor<Meaning>`. Ids are the exception, having natural type names (`GitHubIssueId`). Note the
direction: the alias _splits_ a group rather than uniting one, so it is right only where the meanings
genuinely differ — never a way to make an awkward base name read better. Where the key is ours,
rename it instead.

**The exemption**: a member whose meaning isn't the state it names. `{ current: boolean }` on a
mutable ref cell is `AbortRef`, not `WhetherCurrent`, which would name the syntax.

**The disjointness dividend**: `Can…` is always a capability function and `Whether…` always a flag,
by construction (`canEdit: boolean` is `WhetherCanEdit`, never `CanEdit`). As prose they are
near-synonyms; as families they cannot be confused, which is what makes `CanLoadMore` safe beside
`WhetherHasMore` in one props type. `Maybe` likewise keeps one meaning throughout: this key may be
absent.

## 4. Variants are separate bases, never `Partial<Base>`

A key's `?:`, `| undefined` and `| null` forms are always separate, literal bases. Three
independent supports:

- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` is **off** in `tsconfig.json`, so `path?: string` and
  `path: string | undefined` are materially different contracts: an optional key can be silently
  omitted, while a required-undefinable key forces the caller to pass it;
- `| null` is a wire/serialized shape, not a looser form of either;
- `Partial<Base>` is invisible to a purely syntactic detector, so a later re-inline of the member
  would slip past.

**Rejected**: `Partial<Base>`; a generic `Undefinable<T>` utility; and `Maybe…` on required booleans
(backwards — it pushes the `?:` variant into a clunky `WithOptional…`). Every base is a **literal**
object type for the same reason as the third bullet: a member derived through a mapped utility is
invisible, so a re-inline would slip past.

Collapsing a _drifted_ variant is a **tightening** — the compiler names every site — and never a
loosening. Loosening call sites to merge legitimately distinct signatures would be a contract change
smuggled inside a type-dedup change.

## 5. Distinctions that look alike and resolve differently

Each row is a pair that reads as the other one until you apply the test.

| Looks like                          | Actually is                                                                                      | The discriminating test                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| two shapes                          | one shape under two drifted spellings (`isActive`/`active`)                                      | Is either spelling pinned by an external vocabulary — a wire payload, a library prop? Converge on it; otherwise on the `is`-prefixed one. **Forwarding to a differently-named library prop is not a pin** — that's one boundary line (`loading={isLoading}`), not a shape flowing through the codebase. |
| a drifted stem                      | a **qualified sibling**: the same stem narrowed by a qualifier (`isLoading` vs `isLoadingOlder`) | Does the extra word narrow the _fact_ or only the _spelling_? A qualifier says more — a second flag, so keep both bases. A dropped or added `is` says nothing — drift, so converge per the row above.                                                                                                   |
| a name clash to settle once         | two legitimate needs (`type: PostType` vs `postType: PostType`)                                  | A bare key is inferred from its enclosing type; a qualified key is portable. Both stand, and `WithBare<Type>` discerns.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| qualified siblings to collapse      | several facts, not one drifted name (`ogImage` / `image` / `avatarImage`)                        | Would collapsing require renaming keys at call sites to say nothing new? If so, keep all of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| a base needing an awkward name      | one key covering two unrelated **operations** (`onRefresh` = re-fetch vs `location.reload()`)    | Rename the member if the key is ours — that _dissolves_ the group instead of naming it. Trading a guarded signature for a key that tells the truth is the right trade.                                                                                                                                  |
| an honest base for a mis-named prop | a capability wearing an event's name (`onSettingsOpen`, wired straight to `onClick`)             | Rename the key. Otherwise the prop and its base disagree forever and only the base is right. Counterweight: genuine rule-1 `on*` spellings (`onClose`, `onRetry`) are correct — audit, don't plan a rename wave.                                                                                        |
| the same verb drifting              | the same verb from **opposite ends** (`close` vs `onClose`)                                      | `Closable` = "an owner closes this"; `CanClose` = "the holder closes something". Two bases, not drift.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| a heterogeneous key needing a split | one relationship over different subjects                                                         | `-able` **names the subject**, so it strains when one key covers two operations. `Can…`/`Handles…` are subject-agnostic.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| a meaningful optional               | drift                                                                                            | **Does a real production call site omit the key, or is its absence read as a third state?** Not "could this be optional". A `\|\| undefined` in a mapper is styling parity, not evidence; "could be optional but never is" is not evidence.                                                             |
| a missing base                      | a member already declared elsewhere                                                              | Grep the signature **before** naming anything — and read the candidate's _full member list_: pointing a type at a two-member concept type hands it a member it doesn't have.                                                                                                                            |
| a redundant alias                   | a real composite                                                                                 | A pure rename of a **single** base is redundant — delete it. A two-base intersection with its own meaning and consumers stands.                                                                                                                                                                         |

The optionality verdict varies sharply by family, so plan a callback or domain-typed sweep for
`Undefinable`/`Nilable` siblings rather than for a collapse wave: an absent callback usually means
_render no affordance_ — a third state by construction — where an absent boolean usually just means
`false`.

## 6. Where a base lives, and working a finding

**Home rule**: the topmost module that every declarer already imports and that semantically owns the
member. **Module-local is the default and needs no justification** — when both declarers sit in one
file, the base belongs in that file, and a "why it lives here" docstring clause on such a base gets
deleted. `lib/typings.ts` is for bases that are genuinely cross-cutting or whose declarers share no
natural upstream module; parking everything there by default turns it into a junk drawer and makes
the import graph stop describing anything.

**Don't mint a file per base.** Group them. Upstream's module shapes — `*-mixins.ts`, `*-flags.ts`,
`*-refs.ts` — are the pattern to reach for once `lib/typings.ts` outgrows one file. Rename a module
when its contents outgrow its name.

**Resolve homes after the optionality audit, not before.** A collapse changes which variant reaches
the floor, and can promote a signature the pre-collapse scan scored as a singleton.

The order of work on a finding:

1. **Scope from the tool, never from a table.** Any inventory older than the current `main` is wrong
   in both directions. Re-scan for **signatures**, not field names: one field row can hide a genuine
   type-collision (`file: File` beside `file: string`).
2. **Reuse pass before the naming pass.** Grep every signature for an existing declarer and read that
   candidate's full member list. The naming discussion for a base you then delete is pure waste.
3. **Rename pass.** Is the group a key lying about its meaning (§1)? A rename can dissolve a group
   _or_ create a third consumer for an existing base; the direction depends on whether the key
   **lies** about the meaning or merely **under-describes** it.
4. **Optionality audit** with §5's empirical test, expecting §5's per-family distribution.
5. **Re-scan after the audit** — steps 3–4 change the input to step 6.
6. **Resolve homes** per the home rule above.
7. **Extract**, and delete any alias that collapsed to a pure rename of one base.
8. **Sweep**: orphaned docstrings (§7), then `./scripts/vet.sh`.
9. **For a gate change, assert the failure mode as well as the success one.** A clean run proves the
   repo is deduped; it does not prove the gate still fires. A throwaway two-type file sharing one
   member, confirming the run fails and names the pair, takes ten seconds and is the only evidence
   that distinguishes the two.

## 7. Docstrings on a base

**The rules live here, once.** A base carries no paragraph justifying its name: every base would
need one, and a rule restated in twenty places drifts in twenty places.

**A base's docstring carries only the domain fact its name and signature can't** — which modal
`openSettings` opens, what `onSaved` lets the caller refresh, why `onRetry`'s absence is a third
state, which sibling it is among several qualified siblings over one value type.

**What goes**: naming rationale, rule restatements and cross-references, consumer lists, placement
rationale, and anything restating the name (`CanLoadMore`'s "fetches the next page").

**Placement notes stay only when they name a concrete hazard** — a module that must import nothing,
or a composing hook that cycles back into it — and they get a size check: write the note as a
property of the code rather than as the argument that produced it.

**A comment about a member moves with the member** — onto its own line immediately before the mixin
inside the intersection. Trailing (`Named & // …`) doesn't survive prettier, which re-hugs it into
`Named & { // …` where it reads as a comment on the inline members. When a whole one-field type is
deleted, its comment moves to the parameter it described.

**Repointing orphans docstrings, so sweep per commit rather than once at the end.** Removing a member
leaves its JSDoc dangling before the closing `}` or stacked against the next member's; both compile
and both are invisible in review. Two regex sweeps catch every case — a comment immediately followed
by `};`, and a JSDoc immediately followed by another JSDoc.

## 8. Known gaps

The floor is not complete coverage.

- **`*.test.*` is skipped by design — the permanent gap.** Production re-inlines are impossible, so
  tests are the only place a deduped member can quietly come back. **A test that annotates a shape
  should compose the bases too, and nothing but review will tell you when it doesn't.** There is no
  suite here yet (CLAUDE.md → Testing); the exclusion is inherited so that adding one doesn't
  immediately light the gate up.
- **Inline shapes are invisible at any threshold**, in three positions: a return type, a `const`
  annotation, and — the one that matters most — a **render-prop's argument type**, which is a
  contract between two files and drifts exactly like a named type. So grep the key in inline
  positions too (`{ key:`, `(args: {`), and when you find one, the contract belongs with the
  component that _declares_ the prop, not the one that implements it. Invisibility also cuts the
  other way, as a budget guard: an inline member whose rename would churn ~30 call sites for no
  type-level gain is legitimately left alone.
- **Derived forms are invisible** — `Pick<>`, `Omit<>` and mapped types. Where they conflict,
  **deriving from the source of truth outranks the detector's anchor**: a one-member type that is
  honestly a `Pick<SomeRow, 'field'>` stays one.
- **A member-position check has to parse.** A substring sweep over file text vindicates the very
  lines it exists to catch — a column definition `foo: boolean('foo')` contains `foo: boolean` as a
  substring — so reuse the detector's own `ts.isPropertySignature` walk instead.
- **Branding is deliberately deferred.** For a key spanning several id spaces, the default meaning
  stays a bare `string` and only the foreign meanings get an alias. Branding the default meaning is
  the endgame the seam exists for, not a step in a dedup.
