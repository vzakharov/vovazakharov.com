Bite 3 is yours: docs/plans/world-game-zoltan-syama/bite-3.md is the contract, bite-3/sphere.py and its two frames the lead's probe. Build to the calls in order (call 11); where you cannot keep one, stop and post it with numbers rather than picking another. Your PR targets island/stretch-2, never main. Done means, in this order: frames and numbers per 'Done when'; /polish over your own diff (its polish: commits on the PR, /five-percent posted); /sync-branch against island/stretch-2; vet green; then ping green here. Post at each step's frame (schema+series, cube tiles+eye with #1, Earth+envelopes). Model on every create_session and Agent call: claude-opus-5-5. The board is mine; propose changes through memo.

Contract change, call 3 (4bf97b0b on island/stretch-2): before writing the roll vocabulary, search npm for a ready package — Vova: «перепроверить наличие готовых пакетов, чтобы не изобретать велосипед». Neighbours to check: fast-check-style typed generators over a choice sequence, probabilistic-programming addressed choices with constrained traces (Gen, Pyro), counter-based keyed generators (Philox/Random123, JAX keys). Wanted together: typed schema, path keys, random access by key, pinned values. Post what you found and why you took it or not, then build. Merge origin/island/stretch-2 to get the contract text.

Bite 3 started. Build calls for step A are in bite-3/build.md (R1–R6: path hash over UTF-8 path bytes, roll vocabulary, schema land/{sea,harmonic}+noise/seed, sea constants pinned for ~29% mean land, grid shape measured against 1e-9 round trip and ~1.5 s synthesis). Two agents running: step A (schema + series + atlas frame) and a reader mapping step B (cube tiles, eye, #1 fit). One call I will flag when the reader reports: the contract's call 1 says d = f/|∇f| 'as bite 2 does', but bite 2's B7 replaced that with the true distance after it spiked on saddles — I'll recommend with numbers rather than pick silently.

Seen. On d: 'as bite 2 does' meant whatever bite 2 does now — take B7's true distance on the sphere, no need to argue it with numbers unless its cost on the sphere breaks the 3 s budget. Note my 04:1x memo (package search before the roll vocabulary): your step-A agent is already writing roll, so have it check npm first, or check in parallel and swap if something fits.

Package search for roll (build.md R2a): nothing fits. fast-check, @anatine/zod-mock and json-schema-faker are typed but draw from one sequential stream, so an added leaf shifts later values — call 3's own test fails. squares-rng and Random123 ports give random access by integer counter, no paths, no schema. @thi.ng/random and d3-random are sequential distributions. No maintained JS port of Gen/Pyro addressed choices. Each covers one of the four wants; we keep murmur3 by path plus ~100 lines of vocabulary. d: B7 true distance on the sphere, noted.

Package search accepted: own vocabulary over murmur3-by-path. Carry on; next post at step A's frame.

Step B mapped (notes/b3-map.md) and its calls settled in build.md S1–S6: true distance; equal-angle cube (cell edges within 1.41×); the coast grid set by A's measured cost, 1024×2048 the target; the sun = today's fixed sun turned by the least rotation taking CENTRE to the eye, so any world is lit from any side and #1 looks as today (the one abrupt point is 10° S 180°, open sea); the coast slice returns under scripts/lib, no masd marker; #0 stays H(0,·) until step C. B1 (cube + geo primitives) running beside A. Override any of these here.

S1–S6 accepted. On the sun: I put the choice (sun follows the eye vs a fixed sun with a real night side) to Vova; build yours meanwhile, keep the sun's placement one function so a swap is cheap.
