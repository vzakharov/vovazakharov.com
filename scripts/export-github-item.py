"""Export a GitHub issue or pull request to Markdown plus downloaded attachments.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/export-github-item.py <number|issue-url|pr-url> [--repo OWNER/REPO]

Issues land in docs/issue/<n>/issue.md, pull requests in docs/pr/<n>/pr.md; both
put downloaded attachments under <out-dir>/attachments/. A bare number works for
either — the type comes from the API, not from the argument. A PR export also
carries its review threads: review bodies, inline comments grouped into reply
chains, the diff hunk each chain hangs off, and whether the reviewer resolved it.

Exit status is non-zero when any attachment fails to download; the Markdown is
still written, with the failed attachments still linked remotely.

Auth: uses $GH_TOKEN (or $GITHUB_TOKEN) if set, otherwise falls back to
`gh auth token`. A token is required to download GitHub's private user-image
attachment URLs (private-user-images.githubusercontent.com), which auth-gate
even when the issue itself is public.

The pieces live in `scripts/gh_export/`; running this file as
`python3 scripts/export-github-item.py` puts `scripts/` on `sys.path[0]`, so
both `gh_export` and `lib` resolve as PEP 420 namespace packages from any
working directory — no `__init__.py`, no `sys.path` manipulation.

Stdlib only — no third-party deps, here or under `gh_export/`. Python 3.9+.
