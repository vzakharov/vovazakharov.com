# The mechanics `/update-muthur` shares with the SessionStart nudge that offers
# it: the watermark read, the lock, and the source clone.
#
#   muthur-sync.sh nudge               what the SessionStart hook prints
#   muthur-sync.sh claim [--takeover]  take the lock for the next sync
#   muthur-sync.sh handover <url>      name the session that runs the claimed sync
#   muthur-sync.sh clone <dir>         the source, blobless, at its current HEAD
#
# The watermark is always read **off the trunk**, not the working tree: the lock
# is keyed on it, and a session on an old branch would otherwise ask about a
# lock nobody else is looking at.
#
# The lock is a `muthur-sync-lock-<lastSyncedSha>` branch on this repo's origin,
# holding one commit whose message names the holder. The key is the trunk's
# watermark, so a landed sync moves every session on to a fresh name and the old
# lock stays behind, deleted by nobody, as the record of who synced what, when.
#
# `nudge` never fails the session: every failure is one line of context and exit
# 0, for `prompt-issue-export.sh`'s reason — a session must not fail to start
# over an offer. `claim` exits 3 when the lock is held, 1 on any other failure.
#
# Functions whose output is captured with `$(…)` fail only through an explicit
# `die`: outside POSIX mode bash clears `-e` in command substitutions, so an
# unchecked failure there would carry on rather than stop.

This is an offer to make, not work to start:
- Investigate nothing before the operator says yes: no clone, no `git show`, no
  reading of diffs, no claim. The lists above are the whole input for the offer.
- Offer it once, at a natural moment. A ride-along ("by the way, …") only once
  this session is making a change on this branch, never in answer to a question
  that changes nothing; a new session at the end of a turn that delivered
  something.
- Once made, it is never brought up again — not repeated, reminded of, or
  called still open in a later reply or a handoff report — whether the
  operator declined it or left it unanswered. A relay summary carries one line
  for the next session, "The muthur sync offer was made; do not make it
  again.", and a session whose relay summary has that line makes none.
- Right before making the offer, run `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/@LOCK@`.
  Any output means another session claimed or landed this sync since it was
  printed: drop the offer, and say nothing of it or of the check.
- Which offer: a ride-along when the changes are one or two commits touching
  files here; a new session otherwise.
- On yes, `/update-muthur ride-along` in this session after the task's own
  commits; for a new session, `scripts/muthur-sync.sh claim` first, then
  `/update-muthur claimed` as its prompt and `🔄 muthur → <this repo's name,
  no owner>` as its title, then `scripts/muthur-sync.sh handover <its session
  URL>`, so the lock names the session doing the sync. A claim that exits 3
  means another session got there first: say who holds the lock and drop the
  offer.
  `/update-muthur` § "Offered at session start" has the rest.
