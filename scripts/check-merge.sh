# The single merge-target check behind the `/check-merge` skill. Checks once
# whether the branch's **merge target** has moved out from under the current
# branch since it last incorporated it, or whether the PR landed — then exits so
# the agent can hand back to the enclosing flow.
#
# The merge target is the branch the open PR is **based on** — resolved from the
# PR, not hardcoded to the default branch — so the check is correct for a PR
# based on a promotion branch or a long-lived feature branch, not just `main`.
# It falls back to the repo default branch when there's no PR yet.
#
# Stateless: it computes everything from git on each run (no baseline file). The
# branch's own history is the reference point — once you merge the new target
# into the branch, the next check naturally reports "contained". Nothing to
# reset, and no false "advanced" after a merge you already did.
#
# Lightweight: resolving the target and fetching it is a couple of `gh`/`git`
# calls plus a local ancestry test; the PR state fetched while resolving the
# target also tells a PR that landed from a plain advance, so no second lookup.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-merge.sh    # run once; reports movement / landing
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  - the branch already contains the target's tip (nothing to merge),
#        OR a transient network failure (fails safe rather than crying wolf).
#   10 - the target advanced beyond this branch. The caller deliberates.
#   20 - this branch's PR was merged. The work landed.
#   21 - this branch's PR was closed without merging.
#   1  - hard error (detached HEAD, gh lookup failure, missing tooling).
