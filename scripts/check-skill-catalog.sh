# Assert the skill cross-reference and catalog invariants.
#
#   1. Every `@.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` reference resolves to a file that
#      exists. This is the check that makes subset-copying safe: a skill copied
#      without its closure leaves a pointer that fails *silently* — the agent
#      follows the surviving prose and skips the step it could not load.
#   2. Every `.claude/skills/*/` directory has exactly one row in
#      `docs/catalog.md`.
#   3. Every path named in a catalog row's first column exists — for a row
#      naming a whole tree, its parent, since a swept working-artifact tree is
#      absent by design.
#   4. A skill's two stub markers agree, and no unhydrated stub is present
#      downstream.
#
# Assertions 2-3 skip when `docs/catalog.md` is absent — the normal downstream
# case, since the catalog describes the source repo and is never vendored. So the
# same script is useful at every link in the adoption chain. Assertion 4 runs
# everywhere but changes verdict on the same signal: the catalog's presence is
# what distinguishes "this repo ships the stubs on purpose" from "a stub was
# copied into a project it was never written for".
#
# Reports every failure rather than stopping at the first.
