/**
 * Generates the Sass partials under `styles/` whose contents are fixed by a
 * TypeScript declaration. Run it after editing either source:
 *
 *   pnpm styles:codegen
 *
 * There is no check-only mode: it **exits non-zero when it had to write**, so
 * one run both repairs the drift and reports it. That is what lets the vet run
 * fail on a stale partial while still leaving it fixed — `git diff` is the
 * report, and a second run is green.
 *
 * Both partials exist because Sass and TypeScript each need the same names and
 * numbers and neither can read the other's declaration: Mantine resolves
 * responsive props (`cols={{ base: 1, md: 2 }}`) from `theme.breakpoints` and
 * `cssColor()` types the `--color-*` names, while Sass needs the breakpoints as
 * literals — a media-query condition cannot read a custom property — and is
 * what declares the tokens in the first place. TypeScript is the source in both
 * cases because it is the side a type can constrain.
 *
 * Bare Node runs this file, relying on its type stripping, so the imports of
 * the sources carry their `.ts` extension.
