# Hold the squash proposal's copy-pasteable text to the rules
# `@.claude/skills/squash-message/SKILL.md` states as prose — size caps, and no
# session link in the body — and fail when one breaks. The skill's Step 3 is an
# agent reading their own output; this is the part of that target a machine can
# settle.
#
# There is deliberately no env override: a hatch in the boilerplate teaches
# reaching for it instead of tightening. An adopter needing more room edits this
# copy instead — raising a constant below, or adding the mechanics that decide
# when a wider cap applies.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-squash-message.sh [<path-to-proposal>]
#
# With no argument the proposal is located by the ladder in `resolve_source`,
# because `/finalize` sweeps `docs/remove-before-merging/` before a re-vet can
# run and the file is usually already gone by the time this executes. Finding
# nothing is normal — every lane that vets before `/squash-message` has run has
# no proposal — so that case reports the absence and passes.
#
# POSIX `/bin/sh` with `git` for the history rungs: `scripts/vet.sh` is the one
# entrypoint every adopter must have, so a check it calls must not add an
# interpreter or a `jq`/`gh` prerequisite to the floor.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  - every rule held, or there is no proposal to measure.
#   1  - a cap was exceeded, the body carried a session link, the proposal was
#        unparseable, or bad arguments.
