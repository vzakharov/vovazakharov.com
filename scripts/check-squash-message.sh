# Measure the squash proposal's copy-pasteable text against the size caps
# `@.claude/skills/squash-message/SKILL.md` states as prose, and fail when it is
# over. The skill's Step 3 is an agent reading its own output; this is the part
# of that target a machine can settle.
#
# There is deliberately no env override: a hatch in the boilerplate teaches
# reaching for it instead of tightening. An adopter needing more room edits this
# copy instead — raising a constant below, or adding the mechanics that decide
# when a wider cap applies.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-squash-message.sh [<path-to-proposal>]
#
# With no argument the proposal is located by the ladder in `resolve_source`,
# because `/finalize` sweeps `docs/remove-before-merging/` before a re-vet can
# run and the file is usually already gone by the time this executes. Finding
# nothing is normal — every lane that vets before `/squash-message` has run has
# no proposal — so that case reports the absence and passes.
#
# POSIX `/bin/sh` with `git` for the history rungs: `scripts/vet.sh` is the one
# entrypoint every adopter must have, so a check it calls must not add an
# interpreter or a `jq`/`gh` prerequisite to the floor.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  - every cap held, or there is no proposal to measure.
#   1  - a cap was exceeded, the proposal was unparseable, or bad arguments.
