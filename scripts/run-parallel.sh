#!/bin/sh
# Run several checks concurrently and report only what failed.
#
# Each argument is one check, either `<label>=<command>` (split at the **first**
# `=`) or a bare command that labels itself. Commands run via `sh -c`, so shell
# syntax works inside them.
#
#   scripts/run-parallel.sh lint='pnpm lint' typecheck='pnpm typecheck'
#   scripts/run-parallel.sh 'cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings' 'cargo test'
#
# Splitting at the first `=` keeps a leading environment assignment working when
# the check is labelled (`test='CI=1 pnpm test'`); bare, `CI=1 pnpm test` reads
# as label `CI`. Label everything and the edge never comes up.
#
# Output is buffered per check under `tmp/run-parallel/` and printed only for
# the ones that failed, each line prefixed `[<label>] `. Lines containing the
# check mark are dropped as noise; every failing block ends with the path to its
# verbatim log, which is the way to see what the filter took out. While checks
# are still running, a liveness line names the unfinished ones every 10s.
#
# The run also compares `git status --porcelain` before and after: an autofix
# step (`prettier --write`, `eslint --fix`) rewrites files *and* exits 0, so a
# clean tree that came back dirty is worth naming before it gets committed
# without the fixes. Silently skipped outside a git work tree.
#
# POSIX `/bin/sh` on purpose: `scripts/vet.sh` is the one entrypoint every
# adopter must have, so its helper must not add an interpreter to the floor.
#
# The log directory is wiped at startup, so only one invocation at a time is
# supported.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  - every check passed.
#   1  - a check failed, or the arguments were unusable.
