"""Write operator-attached images out of a Claude Code session transcript.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/extract-session-images.py <transcript.jsonl> [--out DIR] [--verbose]

Each image goes to `tmp/session-images/` (overridable with `--out`), and a row
to `index.md` there carrying the prompt it arrived with — the text is what makes
the image legible to a session that was not present for it. `tmp/` is gitignored,
so an image reaches the repo only when someone puts it there deliberately.
`.claude/hooks/session-images.sh` is the caller, and carries why this runs
without being invoked.

Idempotent: filenames derive from the record's own timestamp and uuid, and the
manifest's SHA-256 column is the dedupe state, so a re-run over the same
transcript writes nothing and there is no second state file to drift.

Exit status is non-zero only when the transcript cannot be read or the output
directory cannot be written. A transcript holding no attachments is success.

`--verbose` reports what was seen and why each record was rejected. The record
shape belongs to the client and is not documented, so when it changes the filter
matches nothing and this exits 0 — that flag is how the silence is diagnosed.

Running this file as `python3 scripts/extract-session-images.py` puts `scripts/`
on `sys.path[0]`, so `lib.media` resolves as a PEP 420 namespace package from any
working directory — no `__init__.py`, no `sys.path` manipulation.

Stdlib only — no third-party deps. Python 3.9+.
