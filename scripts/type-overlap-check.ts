/**
 * Cross-file duplicate type-shape detector.
 *
 * Two passes over the same set of `type` aliases, both purely syntactic and both
 * measured PAIRWISE — for every unordered pair we intersect the pass's sets and
 * report the pair when the intersection meets that pass's floor:
 *
 * - **Shared members**, floor 1. Two members are "the same" when their
 *   normalized signature text (name + optional/readonly modifiers + type
 *   annotation, whitespace-collapsed) is identical. Only a type's OWN members
 *   count: the named constituents of an intersection (`A & { … }`) are treated
 *   as inherited, so extracting a base and having both types `& Base` is exactly
 *   what makes a finding disappear. *Any* member two types both declare is a
 *   finding, so every shared member has a single home.
 * - **Repeated base combinations**, floor 2. The set of constituents the member
 *   pass discards as inherited — `Titled & Described` written across two types
 *   is the same shape under two spellings, one level up. The floor is 2 because
 *   a single shared base is reuse working as intended, and is the end state
 *   every member finding is fixed into.
 *
 * Nothing is grandfathered — a run is either clean or names the pairs to fix.
 *
 * Only `type` aliases are scanned; `interface` is banned repo-wide by
 * `@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-definitions`, which is what makes that
 * scope complete rather than a blind spot.
 *
 * Why the floors are what they are, the naming families, and how to work a
 * finding: scripts/type-overlap-check.README.md.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm type-overlap                             # floors: members 1, bases 2
 *   TYPE_OVERLAP_MIN=3 pnpm type-overlap          # raise the shared-member floor
 *   TYPE_OVERLAP_BASES_MIN=3 pnpm type-overlap    # raise the shared-base floor
 *
 * Exit code is non-zero when either pass has findings.
