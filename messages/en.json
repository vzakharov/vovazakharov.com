      "paragraph1": "Developer with a physics-and-math brain and a knack for building practical tools that turn AI buzz into actual features. Ever since 2019, most of my work revolves around LLMs and image generation, following years of messing with smaller neural networks. This means I <strong>don't buy or sell buzzwords</strong>, I understand things <strong>a level or two deeper than most</strong>, and I've developed an <strong>intuition for what models can and cannot do</strong>.",
      "paragraph2": "I've built systems from scratch, simplified convoluted integrations, and turned vague ideas into working prototypes — across open-source, startups, and global advertising giants."
