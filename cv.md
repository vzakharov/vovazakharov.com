### 🧠 Profile

Developer with a physics-and-math brain, a poet’s love of abstraction, and a knack for building practical tools that turn AI buzz into actual features. I’ve built systems from scratch, simplified convoluted integrations, and turned vague ideas into working prototypes — across open-source, startups, and global advertising giants. I care about types, buttons, and the unspeakable elegance of just-enough abstraction.
