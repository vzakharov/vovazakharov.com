# UserPromptSubmit hook: a session's *first* prompt is the one that gets routed,
# and routing is the step a session skips — it reads the prompt, sees work it
# knows how to do, and starts. What the skipped route costs is the plan-or-not
# call, the quality passes and the PR, so the ladder arrives at the moment the
# call is made rather than waiting in CLAUDE.md to be remembered.
#
# It points at the ladder rather than restating it: CLAUDE.md is resident, so
# the rows are in context already and a copy here would only drift from them.
#
# Only the first prompt. A later turn is a routing point only when it is the
# first to ask for a change in a session still unrouted (CLAUDE.md
# § "Plan mode & questions in web sessions"), and telling that apart takes
# reading the prompt and the conversation, so it is the agent's call — a notice
# on every later prompt would cost a Q&A session context each turn to say
# nothing. A prompt that opens with `/` is already routed: the operator named
# the skill themselves.
#
# Never fails the turn: no `jq`, no transcript, no payload — each path is
# stderr plus exit 0, the contract every hook beside it keeps.

This is the session's opening prompt, so the route comes before the work: read
CLAUDE.md § "Plan mode & questions in web sessions"'s entry ladder, say which
row this prompt is, and enter the skill that row names. That route is what
carries a change through the plan-or-not call and the quality passes onto a PR.
