# SessionStart hook: print who the operator is — their name, their handle, and
# their entry from `.claude/voice/operators/` — into the session context, so the
# agent starts out knowing who it is talking to and how they want to be talked to
# instead of spending a turn resolving it. `.claude/voice/voice.md` is what reads
# this.
#
# Runs everywhere, unlike its two siblings: the agent needs this wherever it runs,
# and `gh` reaches the API through the proxy as well as around it.
#
# The lowercased login is both what the message prints and what names the entry
# file, so the one spelling an agent ever sees is the one the lookup uses. The
# filename is the whole lookup: no parse, so nothing an entry can malform.
#
# `scripts/lib/session-identity.ts` parses the resolved-person line back out of
# the transcript for the cost row's `operator`, so rewording it empties that
# field.
