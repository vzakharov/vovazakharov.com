# UserPromptSubmit hook: copy operator-attached images out of the session
# transcript into the working tree, and name the new ones in the turn's context.
#
# An attached image exists only as base64 inside the transcript on this machine,
# so it dies with the session. Extraction is a hook rather than an instruction
# because the agent forgetting is the failure it exists to remove.
#
# The images land in gitignored `tmp/`, and nothing here commits: an image worth
# keeping is moved into the repo deliberately, which is the decision CLAUDE.md
# § "Writing things down" states. A hook that committed on its own would commit
# to whatever branch HEAD happened to be on; one that wrote into the tree
# `/finalize` sweeps would restore that tree right after the sweep, since the
# manifest it dedupes against is inside it and a sweep then looks like a first
# run.
#
# One event carries this, and measurement rather than assumption says which:
# when UserPromptSubmit fires the prompt being submitted is not in the
# transcript yet — the last record is the `queue-operation` carrying its text
# and never its image data. So an image lands at the start of the following
# turn, ahead of anything that could act on the file or commit it. A `Stop`
# firing would write it one moment sooner, with nothing in between to read it.
#
# Never fails the turn: a hook that breaks a session over a screenshot is worse
# than a lost screenshot, so every failure path is stderr plus exit 0.
