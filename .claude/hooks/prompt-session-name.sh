  node scripts/session-cost.ts --transcript '$transcript' --name '<a few words>'

A short label a person would recognise the session by in a list, in the repo's own terms rather than the prompt's wording. Later runs carry it forward, so it is written once. This asks on each prompt until the field is set and then goes quiet; it does not deserve a turn of its own, so fold it into whatever you were going to run anyway."
