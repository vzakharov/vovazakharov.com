# Sourced by the `UserPromptSubmit` hooks beside it: the payload read, the one
# JSON shape the event accepts, and the guards each of them needs before it can
# do anything.
#
# Every hook sources it as `. "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/lib.sh" || exit 0`,
# so a tree holding a hook without this file skips that hook instead of failing
# the turn — the same contract each hook keeps for its own failures. Which is
# also why taking any one hook means taking this file:
# `.claude/skills/update-muthur/catalog.md` has the row saying so.
#
# `need_command` exits the *hook*, not just itself: a sourced function's `exit`
# ends the script that sourced it, which is the intent — a hook with no `jq` has
# nothing to contribute to the turn.

# The event payload, read once — stdin is a pipe, so a second read gets nothing.
# `field` reads what this leaves behind.

# them without touching the turn.
