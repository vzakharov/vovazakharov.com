# The context budget hook

`hooks/post-tool-context-budget.sh` tells the agent when its session's context
crosses the warning line and the pause line, so work is left resumable
before a compact or a dead session takes the choice away. The warning gives the
work the room up to the pause line, to finish in or to steer to a good stopping
point and pause there; the pause line is where that estimate missed, so it
stops the work where it stands, a last step aside. What the agent does on
each notice is `@.claude/skills/go/SKILL.md` § "Stopping partway releases the
plan".

- **`PostToolUse`, not `UserPromptSubmit`.** The lines are crossed mid-turn, in
  the long autonomous stretches where no operator prompt arrives to fire on.
  `PostToolUse` fires after every tool call and its `additionalContext` reaches
  the model before its next step.
- **The reading is what the last request sent**: the last main-chain assistant
  record's `input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens`.
  `output_tokens` is left out — the next request carries it, and the next
  reading counts it then.
- **Both lines are priced by what `/relay` saves over the next 100k tokens of
  work** (`finish`): the warning where that saving reaches $0, the
  pause where it reaches `CONTEXT_BUDGET_PAUSE_SAVING` percent (default 20) of
  what carrying on costs. The model is `.claude/costs/lib/restart.py`, via
  `hooks/priced_line.py`, and the notice carries the dollars.
  - **Each is capped at its fixed line, 200k and 300k**, so pricing only ever
    moves a line earlier: context quality and the hard window are not cost
    questions.
  - **The requests a slice takes** are this session's own since its last
    boundary, per token of growth; the `REQUESTS_PER_TOKEN` estimate stands in
    until it has grown `MIN_GROWTH`.
  - **The successor's reorientation** is `.claude/costs/lib/orientation.py`'s
    measure — the ledger's definition of acting — from the first source
    `restart.py`'s `reorientation_of` finds one in. The notice names which.
  - **The lines are cached** in `tmp/context-budget/<session_id>.line` and
    recomputed per 10k of growth, since a Python start-up per tool call is what
    this bash hook avoids.
  - **Without the ledger's lib, or under `CONTEXT_BUDGET_LINES=fixed`**, the
    hook runs no Python; those and an unpriced model leave the lines at 200k
    and 300k.
- **The main chain only**, for the session's reading: `isSidechain` records are
  skipped, as is the `<synthetic>` placeholder Claude Code writes for a turn no
  model served — whose zeroed usage would read as a compact and re-arm the
  notices.
- **A subagent gets its own notice, read off its own transcript.** Its tool call
  carries `agent_id` but the parent's `transcript_path`; its own is
  `<transcript_path minus .jsonl>/subagents/agent-<agent_id>.jsonl`, where every
  record is a sidechain one. At a fixed 170k, unpriced, it is told to commit
  what passes, bring its hand-over note current and report — never to pause
  the plan, which would release it while its parent works on.
- **Each notice fires once per climb.** `tmp/context-budget/<session_id>` holds
  the highest level announced, `<session_id>.agent-<agent_id>` a subagent's; a
  reading back under its first line clears it, so a compact re-arms the
  notices. A notice that cannot be recorded is not sent, since
  it would otherwise repeat on every tool call.
- **The operator is resolved only when a notice is about to fire**, with `gh api
user`, since it costs a network call and the ordinary tool call has no use for
  it. Their `auto-relay/<handle>` decides how the pause ends, and
  `@.claude/skills/relay/SKILL.md` § "Auto-relay" owns what it means and who
  writes it. A `gh` that cannot answer, or a token that is not a `User`'s, reads
  as `off` and asks nothing: there is no one to have opted in and nowhere to
  record an answer.
- **Anything unreadable is silence**, never an error: a missing notice costs a
  warning, a hook failing on every tool call costs the session.

`CONTEXT_BUDGET_WARN`, `CONTEXT_BUDGET_PAUSE` and `CONTEXT_BUDGET_SUBAGENT`
each fix their line, in tokens, `CONTEXT_BUDGET_PAUSE_SAVING` moves the priced pause, and
`CONTEXT_BUDGET_LINES=fixed` turns the pricing off — set them in
`.claude/settings.local.json`'s `env` to tune without editing a tracked file.
