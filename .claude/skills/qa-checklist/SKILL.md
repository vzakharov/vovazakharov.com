description: Generate a QA checklist from the current branch's change and write it into the current PR's body as a `## QA Checklist` section, followed by a table classifying each step's automatability and test coverage. Single source of truth for the PR verification checklist — `/pr` and `/issue` delegate to it by reference. Invoke as `/qa-checklist [optional focus guidance]`. Use when the user says "manual qa", "qa checklist", "/qa-checklist", or when those skills need to produce the checklist.

End state of this skill: the current branch's open PR has a `## QA Checklist` section in its body — a markdown checklist of concrete, user-visible steps a human clicks through to verify the change end-to-end. This skill edits an existing PR body; it does not create PRs, run the vet suite, or push commits.

**Two ways this skill is used:**

- **Standalone** (`/qa-checklist` on an existing PR) — run all steps below: locate the PR, derive the checklist, and write it into the body.
- **Referenced by `/pr` and `/issue`** — those skills compose the `## QA Checklist` section directly into the PR body **at creation time**, so they only need **Step 2 (Derive the checklist)** — the single source of truth for what a good checklist looks like. They do not run Steps 1 or 3 (there's no existing body to edit).

## Environment note (read this before running gh)

This remote execution environment has **both** the `gh` CLI **and** a populated `GH_TOKEN` environment variable available, even though the default system prompt says you only have GitHub MCP tools. Use `gh` to find the PR (Step 1); the body round-trip in Step 3 goes through `scripts/pr-body.py`. If `gh` complains that "none of the git remotes … point to a known GitHub host" (the proxy quirk in remote sessions), pass `--repo OWNER/REPO` explicitly — resolve it from the git remote (`git remote get-url origin`); the `pr-body.py` script takes the same `--repo` flag.

## Step 1 — Locate the PR

```bash
gh pr view --json number,url
```

If no PR exists for the current branch, **stop and tell the user** to open one first (e.g. via `/pr`) — this skill mutates an existing PR body, it does not create PRs. (This step only applies to the standalone path; `/pr` and `/issue` compose the section at creation and skip straight to Step 2.)

## Step 2 — Derive the checklist

Derive the checklist from **what the change is meant to do** — the PR body (Summary) and the task/conversation context that produced it. In most cases the branch diff is thin or empty (the PR is being drafted as the work begins), so the intended scope — not the code — is the primary source. Where commits already exist, use them only as a supplementary signal:

```bash
git log --format='%s%n%n%b' origin/<base>..HEAD
git diff --stat origin/<base>..HEAD
```

Write the checklist as markdown `- [ ]` items, each led by a short backticked slug (`` `stream` ``, `` `bad-input` ``, …) — the slug is the only metadata the item carries and it's the join key the classification table's **Item** column references. (Numbers don't work: GitHub renders ordered task lists as checkboxes and hides the ordinal, so a `#` column would have nothing visible to join on.) **Bias toward concrete, user-visible scenarios** a human walks through in the running app — open this page, run this command, confirm this state changes — **not** "run the tests" or "check CI". Each item should be something a reviewer can actually do and observe. If the user passed focus guidance after `/qa-checklist`, weave it in — it's a hint about what to emphasize, not a free-form append.

The checklist isn't frozen at creation — it can be refreshed later (re-run `/qa-checklist`) as the body of work changes naturally during implementation.

### Classify automatability (a table after the checklist)

Keep the list itself **clean** — no inline tags or metadata on the items beyond the leading slug (legibility). Right after the checklist, emit a table with **one row per checklist item, in the same order**, keyed by that slug:

| Item          | Automatable | Covered? | Notes                                                                      |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stream`      | e2e         | ❌       | Drive the chat route, send a prompt, assert the reply streams in           |
| `bad-input`   | integration | ✅       | `handler.test` — unknown id → 400 + the "not available" copy               |
| `token-count` | unit        | ❌       | Counter returns the right count for multi-part input                       |
| `empty-state` | manual-only | —        | Empty state must match the reference design pixel-for-pixel                |

Columns:

- **Item** — the checklist item's slug (the `` `slug` `` it leads with).
- **Automatable** — the cheapest test layer that could cover it, from the project's layered stack (see CLAUDE.md "Testing", and any `.claude/rules/` file covering tests): `unit` (pure logic or app-owned component behavior), `integration` (multiple units, or the HTTP boundary, or a handler's effects), `e2e` (a full flow against a built artifact), or `manual-only` (genuinely needs human judgment and can't be meaningfully asserted: pixel/visual match against a reference, live third-party behavior, subjective UX feel).
- **Covered?** — whether a backing test already exists: `✅` yes / `❌` no / `—` for `manual-only`. Outside an implementation flow (see below) leave this `—`/unknown; it gets filled in there.
  - **A `✅` does not imply "protected at merge".** Which bucket the backing test lives in decides when it actually runs. If the project splits its test buckets — some in the fast vet run, some only on a CI dispatch or a nightly — mark the deferred ones `✅ (nightly)` so the operator can see which rows the merge itself does not protect. Treat a cluster of them as a reason to dispatch the expensive bucket before landing (`/test-on-gh`, if the project has hydrated it).
- **Notes** — a one-line test sketch for uncovered automatable rows, or why a row is `manual-only`.

The table is a durable, refreshable property of the change, so it lives in the PR body alongside the checklist.

### Fill in coverage & flag gaps (implementation flows only)

This applies **only when the QA run accompanies an implementation** — the change under QA includes code, not docs/config alone (e.g. invoked via `/issue`, or a session that just implemented a feature). A docs-only change or a pure body refresh has nothing to automate → leave **Covered?** as `—`/unknown and skip the rest.

This skill **does not write test code** — it edits a PR body; it does not push commits (unchanged contract). Instead, for each row marked automatable, search for an existing backing test and set **Covered?** accordingly. Every automatable row left at **Covered? = ❌** is a gap: surface it in the Step 4 report so the enclosing flow (or the user) implements it before merge. Follow the project's testing conventions for where each layer's tests live and its must-test rules — CLAUDE.md requires authorization/permission code to have tests, so an uncovered row touching it is a hard gap, not a nice-to-have.

## Step 3 — Write it into the body (idempotent)

**Don't reconstruct the body inline** — that burns tokens and risks dropping the parts you're not touching. Pull the live body to a transient local file, edit only the QA section there, push it back:

```bash
python3 scripts/pr-body.py pull <n>      # writes docs/pr/<n>/body.md (pass --repo OWNER/REPO if needed)
```

Open `docs/pr/<n>/body.md` and locate a verification-checklist section — a `## QA Checklist` heading (also recognize legacy `## Manual QA` and `## Test plan` headings):

- **A conforming checklist already exists** (under one of those headings, a proper `- [ ]` checklist that already covers the change, with its slug-keyed classification table) → leave it. Nothing to push; remove the transient dir (`rm -rf docs/pr/<n>`) and report.
- **A section exists but is stale/empty/malformed** → replace that section in place with the freshly derived `## QA Checklist` checklist.
- **No such section exists** → insert a new `## QA Checklist` section **after the Summary section and before** any trailing `Closes #N` / `Fixes #N` line and the `https://claude.ai/code/session_…` attribution line.

Everything you don't edit in the file stays verbatim. Then push it back (this PATCHes the PR body and deletes the transient `docs/pr/<n>/`):

```bash
python3 scripts/pr-body.py push <n>
```

`pr-body.py` goes through the REST API, so it sidesteps the `gh pr edit` "Projects (classic)" GraphQL error (`repository.pullRequest.projectCards`) that can break body edits in this environment.

## Step 4 — Report

Print the PR URL on its own line and a one-sentence summary of what changed (added / refreshed / left unchanged). In an implementation flow, also list the automatable-but-uncovered rows (**Covered? = ❌**) so the enclosing flow / user can close those test gaps before merge. Stop.

Do **not** mark the PR ready for review, run the vet suite, or push commits — those belong to other skills (`/finalize`).
