description: File-based stand-in for plan mode and AskUserQuestion, for web/remote sessions where those UIs are buggy. Write the plan to a reviewable file under docs/plans/ instead of using ExitPlanMode, and ask clarifying questions as numbered prose instead of AskUserQuestion. Use in a remote/web session whenever you would otherwise enter plan mode or call AskUserQuestion.

## Why this skill exists

In Claude Code **web/remote** sessions, the plan-mode approval UI and the `AskUserQuestion` tool are unreliable: after a session sits idle, the backend appears to re-wake it and re-emit the pending plan/question prompt repeatedly, so on return the operator sees the plan (or question) stacked several times, answers given to the superseded prompts are silently lost, and the count scales with idle duration. Since operators run many concurrent web sessions, prompts routinely sit idle — so these two UIs can't be trusted here. This skill routes around both: a plan becomes a file the operator can pull and review at their leisure, and questions become prose that survives in the transcript.

Tracking issue (check here for exact wording / current status): **https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/72704**

## Part 1 — Plan instead of plan mode

A `/plan` session's deliverable is the **pushed plan file**, not code. The operator reviews it from another machine, often hours later, and begins implementation in a **different** session via `/implement <branch>` (`@.claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md` routes that through `/from-branch`, which attaches to the branch and finds the plan under `docs/plans/`) — the handoff works because the plan file rides the branch. So a plan turn ends in a handoff, not a continuation; same-session implementation is the rare exception.

Do **exactly what you would do in plan mode** — same research, same rigor, same "don't touch code until approved" discipline. The _only_ difference is where the plan goes and how it's approved:

- Instead of presenting the plan via `ExitPlanMode`, **write it to `docs/plans/<branch-slug>.draft.do-not-implement.md`** (one file per session; name it after the current branch's task slug, or the issue number when working an issue — e.g. `docs/plans/1234.draft.do-not-implement.md`). The `.draft.do-not-implement.md` suffix is load-bearing: it is the on-disk marker that this plan has **not** been approved, visible in every `ls`, tool-call path, and `git status` so you can't drift past the gate without noticing. This directory is **not** gitignored on purpose: **commit and push it** so the operator can pull and review the plan from another machine. Follow the repo's usual plan-content expectations, including the `## DRY notes` section CLAUDE.md requires.
- **Make line 1 of the file a banner** that restates the gate:
  ```
  > ⛔ **DRAFT — DO NOT IMPLEMENT.** This plan is not approved. Do not edit source while this file is named `*.draft.do-not-implement.md` — prep and spikes go in `tmp/`. On an explicit operator go-ahead, `git mv` it to `*.in-progress.md` and delete this banner (quoting the go-ahead in the commit) *before* touching code.
  ```
- Then **end the turn with the handoff block** (§ "Handing off" below) and stop — do not start implementing.
- **The in-session path is the exception, not the default.** If a literal go-ahead token does arrive in _this_ session, "The approval gate" below governs it unchanged — and on approval you hand off to `@.claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md`, whose Step 1 performs the flip that unlocks source edits (`git mv` the plan to `docs/plans/<branch-slug>.in-progress.md`, drop the draft banner, quote the go-ahead in the commit) as its first action, before any source edit. That flip is the on-record receipt that approval was given, so don't front-run it here; the mechanics live in `/implement` to avoid two copies drifting apart. The gate is exactly as strict on this path as on any other; it just fires rarely.

### Handing off — end the plan turn with a copyable `/implement` block

Get the branch with `git branch --show-current` and substitute the real name. Introduce the block with wording that **names the new session** — `To implement — start a new session with:`, or an unmistakable equivalent. That lead-in is what carries the session model to the operator; a bare "To implement:" reads as an offer to do it here, which is the misreading the block exists to remove. Emit the command in a fenced block containing **only** the command — no language tag, nothing else inside the fence — so it can be copied verbatim:

````
```
/implement claude/add-usage-charts-k3n2af
```
````

- Emit it at the end of **every** turn that leaves the plan in a reviewable, complete state — the turn that first writes the plan, and any later turn that revises or collapses it (Part 3). One block per turn, as the last thing in the reply.
- **Open questions don't hold the block back when they carry recommendations.** Part 2 requires every fork to name a recommended option _and_ the plan file to be written with that option already in force, so implementing it unanswered is the same as adhering to the recommendations. Emit the block alongside the questions: an answer that differs revises the plan, and silence is a valid resolution. Hold the block only for a fork with no recommendation, where the plan has nothing executable to say until the operator picks — handing over a command to implement a genuinely unresolved fork invites implementing the wrong one.
- **Never** close a plan turn with "Want me to implement it?", "Shall I proceed?", "Ready for me to start?", or any equivalent. Two reasons: the plan session does not implement, so there is nothing to ask; and a turn that ends on that question trains the agent to read the operator's _next_ message as an answer to it, so a correction ("actually, do X instead") gets taken as assent and code starts getting written. The handoff block is the structural fix that the approval gate's "a suggestion is a plan revision" and Part 3's "picking an option is not a signal to implement" can only exhort.
- The block is built for a session that does not exist yet, which is why the lead-in names it. Pasting it back into _this_ session is a recognizable mistake with its own guard — see `@.claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md` § "Branch-name form" for the canary that catches it.

### The approval gate

**Only start implementing when the operator's message literally contains a go-ahead token** — "go ahead", "let's go ahead", "implement", "let's implement", or an unmistakable equivalent ("ship it", "do it", "proceed", "lgtm go"). Until such a token arrives, you are still in the planning conversation, no matter how the exchange evolves.

- **A suggestion to do something differently is a plan revision, not a go-ahead.** When the operator proposes an alternative approach, tweak, or "how about we…", that means **update the plan file (or discuss it) to reflect the new direction** — it does **not** mean start coding with the suggestion folded in. Reflect the change in the plan and wait for the token.
- **The exception is a combined message:** if the same message pairs a suggestion _with_ a go-ahead token — e.g. "let's do X instead of Y and implement", "go ahead, but use Z" — then apply the suggestion and proceed. The token is what unlocks implementation; the suggestion just adjusts what you implement.
- **When unsure whether a reply is approval, treat it as not-yet-approved** — and resolve the ambiguity by re-emitting the handoff block, not by asking for a yes. A false start costs more than one more round-trip: reverting speculative code and re-aligning is worse than handing the command over again.
- Approval is scoped to the plan as it stands when the token is given. A go-ahead on Monday's plan doesn't authorize a materially different Tuesday reshaping — re-confirm if the plan changed since.
- The `*.draft.do-not-implement.md` → `*.in-progress.md` rename is the **single act** that unlocks source edits, and it belongs at the moment of the go-ahead — as the first thing you do after it, not retroactively once code is already written. If you catch yourself about to edit source while the file still says `do-not-implement`, that is the gate firing: stop and check whether the go-ahead token actually arrived.

This gate applies to the **initial** transition from planning to implementing. Once you're past it and actively implementing an approved plan, the "Scope" section below governs: follow-ups are handled directly, including code changes the operator asks for, without reopening a plan cycle.

### Plan file lifecycle

The plan file carries its state in its name, and moves through it by `git mv` (the base slug never changes):

1. `docs/plans/<slug>.draft.do-not-implement.md` — written here, awaiting the operator's go-ahead.
2. `docs/plans/<slug>.in-progress.md` — flipped as the first post-go-ahead action (above); `@.claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md` owns implementing against it.
3. `docs/plans/<slug>.completed.md` — flipped by `/implement` once implementation and its quality passes are done, just before the draft PR.

Every state still matches `docs/plans/*.md`, so consumers that glob the directory (`/implement`, `/from-branch`, `/finalize`, `/tighten-docs`) keep working unchanged.

The plan file is a working artifact, not a deliverable: it rides the branch for review but must **never land on the trunk**. `@.claude/skills/finalize/SKILL.md` deletes the entire `docs/plans/` tree in the last commit before `gh pr ready` (any suffix — `git rm -r docs/plans/`), so the add-then-delete pair cancels out in the squash — the same lifecycle as `docs/issue/`. Do **not** delete it yourself mid-task; leave that to finalization.

## Part 2 — Questions as numbered prose instead of AskUserQuestion

When you would otherwise call `AskUserQuestion`, **ask the same questions, with the same options you'd have offered** — just render them as prose in your chat reply instead. Preserve the fast-answer affordance: **number each question and letter each option**, and state which option is the default/recommended, so the operator can reply tersely (e.g. "1b, 2a, 3-default") without typing prose back. This keeps the whole exchange in the durable transcript rather than in the flaky question UI.

**A recommendation is a commitment, not a lean.** Write the plan file with the recommended option already in force as its single approach — the same collapse Part 3 performs when the operator picks — so an open question degrades into "the recommendation stands" instead of a blocked fork, and the plan is implementable as written no matter which questions go unanswered. That is what lets the handoff block go out with questions still open (Part 1) and lets `/implement` proceed without the answers (`@.claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md` § "Step 1"). A fork you can't recommend either way is the exception, and it does block: say so explicitly in the plan rather than picking silently.

## Part 3 — When the operator picks an option

Whenever the operator resolves one of the option forks you presented — by choosing an option, in whatever words ("the recommended one", "B", "the retry approach", "not the fixed cap") — **rewrite the plan so the chosen option _is_ the plan**: written as the single approach, in the imperative, as if it had never been one of several. No special keyword is required; a plain choice is the trigger. This is the one sanctioned plan rewrite, distinct from the "don't churn the plan after approval" rule in Part 1 (which forbids re-editing per code change during implementation — collapsing a resolved fork _before_ implementing is expected and wanted).

**Picking an option is not a signal to start implementing.** Collapse the plan and then stop — and here "stop" means ending the turn with the handoff block (Part 1 § "Handing off"), same as any other turn that leaves the plan reviewable. Unless the operator's message _also_ explicitly asks you to begin (e.g. "pick B and implement it"), a bare choice means "record this decision," not "go" — when in doubt, hand the command over instead of writing code.

**Delete the rejected options' exposition to save context** — the plan gets re-read on every resume, so carrying dead alternatives is a standing tax. You may keep a brief note of what was rejected, but cap it at **one paragraph covering _all_ rejected options for that fork** (per fork), stating just what was ruled out and the one-line why (especially when the "why" is a hard finding worth not rediscovering). Drop the per-option cost/mechanics detail entirely. If several independent forks were resolved, each may keep its own one-paragraph note.

Then commit and push the rewritten plan (this refresh is explicitly wanted, so it's not the churn Part 1 warns against).

## Scope

This is a **web/remote-session** workaround, and it applies to **new** sessions — see CLAUDE.md ("Plan mode & questions in web sessions") for exactly when it's mandatory vs. optional. It is **not** for continued work: once a plan has been approved and you're implementing, handle the operator's follow-ups directly — answer their questions in chat **and implement any code changes they ask for** — without re-writing the plan file or reopening a plan cycle.

A `/from-branch` launch counts as continued work, not a new session: the skill attaches to an existing branch or PR to resume work started elsewhere, so **do not open a plan cycle for it** — even though it's the first message of the session. Follow its embedded follow-up (or wait for the operator's) directly. The only exception is if that follow-up explicitly asks you to plan a fresh, separable piece of work.
