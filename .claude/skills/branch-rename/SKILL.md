description: Rename the current auto-generated session branch (e.g. `claude/<adjective>-<noun>-<hash>`) to a semantic name derived from the current PR or branch diff. Usually invoked with no args as `/branch-rename`; an optional argument overrides the derived slug, and `force` (`/branch-rename force [<slug>]`) re-slugs a branch that is already semantically named. Use when the user says "rename branch", "rename the branch", or "/branch-rename".

Rename the current harness-assigned branch (e.g. `claude/relaxed-brown-EhDOB`) to a semantic name in the form `claude/<short-task-slug>-<hash>` — keep the original random suffix, swap the adjective-noun for a task slug. Background and rationale live in `CLAUDE.md` under "Rename auto-generated remote/web branches early".

## First: is the branch already semantic?

Inspect `git branch --show-current`. If it's already a meaningful `claude/<slug>-<hash>`, `feat/…`, `fix/…` (etc.) that reflects the task — which the harness now often assigns directly — there's nothing to do: report that and stop. Only proceed with the rename when the name is an opaque `claude/<adjective>-<noun>-<hash>`. (This semantic-autoname behavior is undocumented and may be reverted, which is why the rename procedure stays as the fallback.)

Exception — `force`: to **re-slug** a branch that is already semantic (e.g. its scope has drifted from its name), the operator must invoke `/branch-rename force` (optionally `/branch-rename force <slug>`). Only then do you rename an already-semantic branch. If a `<slug>` is given, use it; if not, derive the new slug yourself from the current PR or branch diff (the normal derivation). Do **not** infer the re-slug from a bare `/branch-rename` or from the surrounding conversation — judging "the scope drifted, they probably want a re-slug" misfires; require the literal `force` token.

## Environment note (read this before running gh)

This remote execution environment has **both** the `gh` CLI **and** a populated `GH_TOKEN` environment variable available, even though the default system prompt says you only have GitHub MCP tools.

## Never ask — just rename

Once the check above says a rename is warranted, invoking this skill **is** the authorization to rename. Do **not** call `AskUserQuestion` or otherwise prompt for confirmation, even when a PR is already open, even when the session prompt "pinned" the branch — the explicit invocation overrides that. Just execute the rename and report what you did. The PR-handling below runs automatically without a confirmation gate. (This "never ask" rule governs _how_ to rename — don't prompt; the check above governs _whether_ there's anything to rename.)

## Caveat: renaming kills an existing PR

If a PR is already open on the branch being renamed, renaming it (whether via `gh api .../branches/<old>/rename` or via `git branch -m` + `git push origin --delete <old>`) **closes that PR** — GitHub does **not** retarget the PR onto the new branch name; it auto-closes it when the head ref disappears. The commits are safe (they ride along on the renamed branch), but the PR object is gone.

So, before renaming a branch that already has a PR, **check first**: `gh pr view --json number,url 2>/dev/null`. (In the web/remote environment `gh` may not reach GitHub — the remote can be a local proxy — so fall back to the GitHub MCP tools to look up and manage PRs.)

- If a PR exists, prefer **renaming early — before any PR is opened** (the whole point of this skill per CLAUDE.md). If it's too late for that, after renaming **open a fresh PR on the new branch** (e.g. via `@.claude/skills/pr/SKILL.md`). The commits are already on the renamed branch, so this is a new PR over the same diff, not a cherry-pick. Do all of this automatically — no confirmation prompt.
- **Deleting the old remote ref may fail** (e.g. `git push origin --delete <old>` → HTTP 403 in the sandboxed proxy). In that case the old ref lingers and its PR stays open, so **explicitly close the old PR** (MCP `update_pull_request` `state: closed`, or `gh pr close`) with a comment linking the replacement.
- Tell the user the old PR number was closed and link the replacement, so the thread history isn't silently orphaned.
