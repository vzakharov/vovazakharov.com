  Check once whether the branch's merge target (the branch its PR is based on)
  advanced or the PR landed since the branch was last attested, then hand any
  advance back to the enclosing flow to decide. While the PR is open, also
  reconcile the `Proposed squash title/body:` comment `/finalize` left on it —
  editing that comment in place when the branch has drifted from it. A manual
  one-shot — run it when you return to a session whose branch is attested to see
  if the merge target moved out from under the branch. Pass an optional
  branch/PR target first (`/check-merge <branch|#PR|PR-url>`) to attach to that
  existing branch before checking. Use when the user says "check merge",
  "check main", "did main move", "/check-merge", or equivalents.

**Optional branch/PR target**: if the first token of the argument is a branch name, `#NNN` PR number, or PR URL, then `/check-merge <target>` is shorthand for attaching to that branch first and then checking — equivalent to `/from-branch <target> /check-merge`. Load `@.claude/skills/from-branch/SKILL.md` and follow it to attach to `<target>`, then run the check below. With no argument, check the current branch as usual.

Check **once** whether the branch's **merge target** has moved out from under the branch, or whether the PR landed. The merge target is the branch the open PR is **based on** — resolved from the PR, not hardcoded to `main` — so this stays correct for a PR based on a promotion branch or a long-lived feature branch. With no PR it falls back to the repo default branch. Once the branch is attested the enclosing flow **ends its turn** (so the session reads as **idle**, not pinned as "working"); when the operator returns and runs `/check-merge`, this performs a single check and reports. This is the last check before the code lands: nothing runs at merge time, so a base that moved out from under an attested branch has no CI anywhere to catch it. An attestation names the base SHA it was made against (`/finalize` Step 7) — this is the check that says whether that SHA is still current.

The check is **stateless** — it computes everything from git on each run, comparing the branch's own history against the freshly-fetched target tip. There's no baseline file to record or reset: the branch's last merge of the target _is_ the reference point, so once you merge a newer target in, the next `/check-merge` simply reports "contained".

This skill **detects** movement and **hands back** to the enclosing flow (usually `/finalize`) — it does **not** decide what to do about a move, drive any re-merge, or re-attest. The "what to do when the base advanced" rules live in the enclosing flow. The one thing it does actively maintain is the squash-message PR comment: whenever the PR is open it reconciles the `Proposed squash title/body:` comment against the branch's current state and edits it in place if it drifted (Step 3).

`/finalize` reaches this at its very end, just before it attests. It can also be invoked directly.

## Why the check is cheap

Resolving the target and fetching it is a couple of `gh`/`git` calls plus a local ancestry test. The single `gh pr list` that resolves the target's base ref also returns the PR state, so a landing (merged/closed) is classified from that same call — no second lookup.

## Step 1: Run the check once

Run `scripts/check-merge.sh` once via the Bash tool — synchronously (foreground), **no `run_in_background`**. It returns immediately. Read the printed line / exit code and act:

- `0` — the branch already **contains** the target's current tip (nothing to merge), and the PR is still open. → Report "no movement; branch is current with `origin/<target>`" and **stop**. The operator can run `/check-merge` again later. (Exit 0 also covers a transient network blip — the message says so; just re-run.) The printed line names the resolved `target=…`, so a base other than the default branch is visible at a glance.
- `10` — the target **advanced** beyond this branch. → Step 2.
- `20` — this branch's PR was **merged**. The work landed. → Report and **stop**.
- `21` — this branch's PR was **closed without merging**. → Report and **stop**; do not re-merge or re-CI.
- `1` — hard error (detached HEAD, `gh` lookup failure, missing tooling). → Surface it and stop.

No setup is needed before this — there's no baseline to establish. The check compares the branch's history against the live target tip every run, so it's correct whether it's the first call after the branch was attested or a later one after you've merged the target in.

## Step 2: Target advanced — hand back to the enclosing flow

Do **not** decide here, and do **not** name a specific flow. State plainly what the check reported (`origin/<target>` advanced `base..new`) and **hand control back to the enclosing flow**, which decides per _its own_ target-advanced rules:

- When the enclosing flow is `/finalize`, follow the deliberation in its Step 6 (read the incoming diff; re-run the vet suite and re-attest only when the commits plausibly interact with this branch; otherwise merge-and-resume). Once the new target tip is merged into the branch, a later `/check-merge` reports "contained" again, so the cycle continues until the PR lands.
- If invoked standalone with no enclosing flow to hand back to, deliberate per the same criteria (load `@.claude/skills/finalize/SKILL.md` Step 6) before acting — don't reflexively skip re-verification. On the demonstrably-independent path just merge and push.

The cycle always terminates: merging the advance in makes the next check "contained", and the merge (exit 20) / close (exit 21) outcome is always reachable on a later `/check-merge`.

## Step 3: Reconcile the squash-message comment (PR open only)

Applies whenever the PR is still **open** — after a `contained` (exit `0`) check, or after the enclosing flow has merged an `advanced` (exit `10`) tip back in. Skip it for a landed/closed PR (exit `20`/`21`) and for a hard error (exit `1`).

The copy-ready squash message rides the PR as a comment headed `Proposed squash title/body:` — two separate fenced code blocks (title, then body) sitting next to the merge button — posted when `/pr` opened the PR. It goes stale as the branch moves: a base-advanced re-merge pulls in work that shifts the essence, a `Closes #N`, or the body bullets; a recreated PR changes the `(pr #<n>)` suffix. This step keeps it current.

Invoke `@.claude/skills/squash-message/SKILL.md` in **`update-only`** mode, passing the base the check resolved (the `target=…` the script printed) as the diff base. That skill recomputes the title/body from the branch's current committed state — including its draft-then-tighten pass — and edits the existing comment in place if it drifted. The reconcile may push a commit as well as edit the comment — `/squash-message` decides, from the working file it selects. `update-only` is what keeps this step from creating a proposal no earlier step made: absence is reported, not filled in. Report what it reports.

On the `advanced` (exit `10`) path the squash body depends on the merged-in work, so run this reconcile **after** the enclosing flow incorporates the advance (Step 2's hand-back) — before then the branch doesn't yet contain what will land. If the advance isn't merged in this turn, defer the reconcile to the next `/check-merge`, which will see `contained`.

This is the check most likely to find something the record should mention — an advanced base carrying work the essence has to account for — and by the time an operator runs it, `/finalize` has usually swept the tracked doc. That doesn't mean composing a new message over the top of the old one: `/squash-message` restores the swept file from git history and edits forward from its last text, then sweeps it again in the same turn. Don't hand-roll either half here; it owns both.
