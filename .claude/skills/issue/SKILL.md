description: Compatibility redirect — the work `/issue` names is spread across three skills, so this one forwards. Invoke as `/issue <what to do> #<N>` and it runs `/plan`; with no number it names `/task` and stops. Kept because handoff blocks and muscle memory still say `/issue`.
---

`/issue` is the name three skills stand behind. Reading an issue is
`@.claude/skills/take-issue/SKILL.md`, which nothing but a skill calls; deciding
what happens to one is spread across `/task`, `/plan` and `/go`. So this name
forwards on the one thing that distinguishes the cases rather than
unconditionally: whether the argument carries an issue number.

**With a `#<N>` in the argument:** load and follow
`@.claude/skills/plan/SKILL.md`, passing the argument through unchanged —
prose, number and all. Then say in one line that `/task` and `/go` take that
same argument: `/task` hands the plan-or-not call back to the agent, and `/go`
skips it.

`/plan` is the default of the three because it is what `/issue … #<N>` invoked
before the split, so it is what an operator typing the old name is expecting to
happen.

**With no number:** there is no issue to take, so the prose is an ordinary task.
Name `@.claude/skills/task/SKILL.md` and stop rather than running it — the old
name meant "an issue is involved", and a run that quietly drops that premise is
one the operator cannot see they got. Filing it as an issue first is theirs to
do by hand, this repo opening issues that way.

Do not act on the summary above — this file carries no procedure of its own
beyond the fork, and `/handle`'s Do-NOT names acting on a one-line summary of a
skill as the failure mode.
