  Review the prose you added in recent work — code comments, docstrings, and
  Markdown — against three equal defects: it should not exist at all (a
  description of how the code works, recoverable by reading it, or written
  somewhere nothing reaches), it narrates the change instead of stating the
  code's lasting contract ("no longer parsed", "now also sets X", "migrated from
  Y"), and it spends more words than it informs — restating what the name,
  signature, and types already say, or stretching a real point over four lines.
  Rewrites, moves and cuts in place. Invoke as: /tighten-docs [existence |
  durability | tightness] [optional focus guidance] — naming one lens runs only
  that lens.

You are reviewing prose _you_ recently added — code comments, docstrings, and
Markdown (skill bodies, `docs/`, READMEs) — for three defects that carry
**equal weight**:

- **Existence** — text that should not have been written: a description of how
  the code works rather than a constraint on it, something a reader recovers from
  the code itself, or a real constraint filed where nothing will load it.
- **Narration** — text that describes the change relative to the previous
  intra-PR step rather than the code's durable behaviour. CLAUDE.md: "Comments
  describe the code's lasting contract, not the change that produced it."
- **Bloat** — text that spends more words than it informs: it restates what the
  function name, signature, and types already convey, or stretches a real point
  past the length it needs. CLAUDE.md's docstring rule: document only the
  non-obvious contract (side effects, runtime constraints, cross-boundary
  coupling, don't-change-this traps).

The output is **edits, not a report**. Fix the clear cases in place; only ask
about genuinely ambiguous ones.

This skill is the long version of CLAUDE.md § "Writing things down", and the only
home for these rules.

## Single-lens mode

The argument may **name one lens** — `existence`, `durability` (alias
`narration`), or `tightness` (alias `bloat`) — optionally followed by focus
guidance: `/tighten-docs durability`, `/tighten-docs tightness src/db`.
Then run **only** that lens: skip the other two in Step 2, apply only its fixes
in Step 3, and report only its group in Step 5. This is the mode for "I just saw
archaeological narration in there" — a targeted pass, not the full sweep.

With no lens named, all three run.

## When to use

- After an autonomous run (several commits since the operator last engaged),
  before handing back — all three defects accumulate step-to-step.
- Any time you notice a comment reads like a diff note, or a docstring restates
  its own signature. If that is the whole complaint, name the lens.
- Skip if recent work added no prose (pure logic/test edits with no new comments).

## Step 1: Scope to what you added since the operator last engaged

In order:

1. **Uncommitted changes**: `git diff HEAD` + untracked files (`git status --short`).
2. **Commits since upstream / since the operator's last turn**: `git log --oneline @{u}..HEAD`, or the SHA range the session summary names. `git diff <range>` is the scope.
3. **Nothing matches** → tell the user there's nothing to review and stop.

Only the **added/changed** prose lines are in scope — don't rewrite pre-existing
comments you didn't touch.

## Step 2: Read each added prose line and ask all three questions

A line can fail any of the three, or several. Work through the diff **once**,
applying all three lenses to each comment — not one traversal per lens. (In
single-lens mode, only the named one.)

### Lens A — should it exist at all?

The default is not to write it. Prose costs context on every session that loads
it, and it goes stale invisibly — a constraint survives a refactor, a description
of how the constraint works does not.

Keep it only when **all three** hold:

1. It is a **constraint or an accepted cost**, not a description of how the code
   works.
2. It is **not recoverable** from the code and its docstrings by someone reading
   them — _or_ recovering it means taking in more modules and flows at once than
   anyone holds in their head, where a paragraph gets there faster. Even then, the
   candidate is a **docstring at the topmost point of the code**, not a separate
   file.
3. **Getting it wrong breaks something** — you can name the specific way a future
   editor goes astray without it.

Then check it is in the right home, and **move it if it isn't** — a rule that only
one call site can violate is a comment; a page nobody's glob reaches is nothing.
The homes, in order of preference — take the first that fits:

| #   | Home                                                          | What lives there                                                                             |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **A comment at the call site**                                | A trap that lives at one line                                                                |
| 2   | **A docstring at the topmost point of the code it describes** | How a flow works, when following it means holding more modules in your head than fit at once |
| 3   | **`.claude/rules/<area>.md`** (frontmatter `paths:`)          | An obligation every edit in the matched files must respect                                   |
| 4   | **A colocated `README.md`**                                   | The big picture, for when not having it is itself what blocks the edit                       |
| 5   | **A skill** (`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`)                | A procedure someone executes                                                                 |

**The alternatives already live in the PR or issue thread, and any of the five
homes can cite it.** Add a `#1234` beside the line where a reader would otherwise
stop and wonder "hmm, why this and not the obvious thing?"; leave it off where
nobody would ask, because a citation on an unsurprising line is one more thing to
chase.

**Rule or README?** A rule is what every edit in the matched files must respect
_whether or not the editor went looking_ — an obligation you can violate without
noticing. It loads automatically, so it must stay short and always-relevant. A
README carries the part the code cannot: **why** the arrangement is this one,
where reading the modules end to end still leaves the reason obscure. It is
opened on purpose, by someone who has already noticed they are lost, and it runs
as long as that explanation takes. **The default is a rule**; reach for a README
when the obscure _why_ is the thing worth writing, and spending every matched
edit's context on it would be the wrong trade.

**Never create a new top-level doc without asking the operator** — and when you
ask, argue the "don't" side. A top-level doc is the one home nothing scopes, so
every later session pays for it; an operator waving it through is easy to get and
is not the same as it being right. If nothing in the list fits, that is usually
the signal it does not need writing at all.

**Touching documented code is not a reason to edit the doc.** Edit a rule when
the _constraint_ changed — not when code near it moved, was renamed, or grew a
feature. A rule that names a function, module path or column is already suspect:
name it only when the rule is _about_ that name.

### Lens B — is it narration?

A line is narration when it only makes sense to a reader who knows the previous
step. Tells:

- Change verbs anchored to the past: **"no longer"**, **"now also"**, **"used to"**,
  **"previously"**, **"migrated from"**, **"this used to…"**, **"as of this change"**, **"renamed from"**.
- **"for now" / "temporarily" / "once X lands"** — situational hedges that go stale.
- References to a prior step, ticket, or version as if the reader is watching the diff.

The test: **would this sentence still be true and useful to someone reading the
final code a year from now, with no memory of the edit?** If it only informs
"what changed", it's narration.

### Lens C — is it bloat?

A line is bloat when it costs a reader more than it tells them — either they
already had the fact from the name, signature, and types, or the fact is real
but buried in twice the prose it needs. Tells:

- **Restates the signature** — names the params or return type, or paraphrases the
  function name (`/** Fetches the user by id. */` over `fetchUserById(id: string)`).
- **Narrates the next lines of code** — "Loop over the items and set the flag",
  "If the list is empty we skip".
- **Restates a type's or enum's members** in prose sitting next to the declaration.
- **Ceremony** — "This function is responsible for…", "Helper that…", "Note that…"
  wrapped around one actual fact.
- **A docstring block on something that crosses no boundary** — the contract is
  already obvious from name + types, so the block is decoration.
- **Length**: **> 4 lines** is almost certainly too much; find the one or two facts
  that aren't self-evident and keep only those. Even exactly 4 is too much unless
  it's a proper docstring block on a function/class/etc. **A good inline clarification
  fits ~2 lines.** The point is often real and the prose still too long:
  - "We await this before returning, because otherwise the transaction may still be
    open by the time the caller commits, which can deadlock under concurrent writes."
    → "Await before returning — an open transaction here deadlocks concurrent writes."
  - "It's worth noting that this cache can only be used on the server, since the key
    includes the workspace id and the browser bundle has no access to it."
    → "Server-only: the cache key needs the workspace id."
- **Markdown**: an added paragraph that re-explains what the adjacent bullet or code
  block already shows; a "Note:" restating the rule directly above it.

## Step 3: Fix

**Existence:**

- **Delete** when the line describes how the code works, or restates something a
  reader recovers from the code — that is the most common outcome and it is a
  clean one.
- **Move** when the constraint is real but mis-homed: a rule only one call site
  can violate becomes a comment there; a paragraph of orientation in a rule
  becomes a colocated README; a procedure becomes a skill. State it once in its
  new home rather than in both.
- **Keep** a named trap beside the thing it traps, and a decision's alternatives
  in the PR thread with a `#1234` from the docstring that needs them.

**Narration:**

- **Rephrase to a present-tense property** when the underlying fact is durable:
  "The emoji is no longer parsed" → "Nothing parses the emoji." "Now also sets
  `x`" → "Sets `x`."
- **Delete** when the note carried no lasting information beyond the change
  itself ("Migrated from the old helper", "Renamed for clarity").
- **Keep** genuine forward-references to still-pending work (e.g. "§F2 is
  deferred") and durable rationale phrased in the present ("kept in sync by
  hand because…"). These are contracts, not changelog.

**Bloat:**

- **Cut to the non-obvious facts** — the side effect, the runtime constraint, the
  coupling, the trap. Drop every clause the name and types already carry.
- **Downgrade a docstring block to a one-line inline comment inside the function**
  when its only real purpose is a don't-break-this warning — CLAUDE.md says the
  dev editing the code will see it there, and that's enough.
- **Delete entirely.** This is a normal outcome and often the right one; a comment
  the code already makes true earns nothing by being shortened.
- If you can't say it in ~2 lines, question whether the **code** should be clearer
  rather than the comment longer.

**Resolve the lenses in order** — deciding a line shouldn't exist saves you
rewording it, and deciding what it should say saves you shortening the wrong
sentence.

## Step 4: Do NOT touch

- **Commit messages and PR bodies** — narrating the change is their job.
- **`docs/plans/*.md`** — transient by nature, swept at finalize.
- **`docs/remove-before-merging/squash-message.md`** — a commit body, and transient
  by nature.
- **CHANGELOG / release-notes files** — a dated record of changes is the point.
- **Deliberately thorough reference prose** — length carrying rationale the
  reader can't get elsewhere is not bloat; length carrying nothing is. But that
  describes a colocated `README.md`, opened on purpose, not a
  `.claude/rules/*.md` file: **a rule's length is a budget**, because it loads in
  full every time its glob matches. Paragraphs of rationale in a rule are a Lens
  A finding — the orientation belongs in a README the rule links to.

## Step 5: Report + commit

Report the three classes **separately, each with a count**, one bullet per fix
(`file:line` + before → after in a few words):

```
Existence (2)
- src/foo.ts:22 — deleted (describes what the next three lines do)
- .claude/rules/bar.md:40 — moved to src/bar/README.md (orientation, not an obligation)

Durability (2)
- src/foo.ts:14 — "no longer parsed" → "Nothing parses the emoji."
- …

Tightness (3)
- src/bar.ts:8 — 7-line docstring → 2 lines (dropped param restatement)
- src/baz.ts:31 — deleted (signature says it)
- …
```

All three groups always appear; **an empty one gets a sentence saying why** rather
than silence ("nothing added was over-documented" is a real outcome). In
single-lens mode, only that lens's group is reported.

Then commit the edits (on a feature branch, just commit — the vet run happens at
milestones via `/finalize`, not per commit).
