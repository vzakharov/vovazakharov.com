description: Own the PR object for the current branch — rename the harness auto-branch (via the branch-rename skill), push, then open the draft PR or refresh the one that already exists, with a title and body derived from the branch. Takes no arguments. Use when the user says "/pr", "open a PR", "draft PR", "open a draft", or similar after committing some work.
---

End state of this skill: a draft PR exists against `<base>`, targeting a semantically-named branch (`claude/<task-slug>-<hash>`), with a title and body describing what the branch delivers, and with the copy-ready squash proposal posted as a comment and tracked on the branch per `@.claude/skills/squash-message/SKILL.md`.

## Modes

`/pr` takes **no arguments** — new work is `@.claude/skills/plan/SKILL.md`, which publishes its own plan through this skill, and unplanned work is `@.claude/skills/go/SKILL.md`. What this skill owns is the PR object, in three modes. The branch decides which one, not the caller:

| Invocation                                     | Behavior                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **plan-open** (caller: `/plan`'s publish step) | rename → push → create draft → body **from the plan**, since there is no diff yet → `/squash-message`                |
| **`/pr`, no PR**                               | open from the commits already on the branch                                                                          |
| **`/pr`, PR exists**                           | **refresh**: re-compose the body against the real diff — Step 4 unchanged, a REST `PATCH` in place of `gh pr create` |

Refresh exists because the body written at plan time is a **forecast**. Step 4 writes the Summary from the branch and delegates the QA section to `/qa-checklist`; at plan time both come from the plan. By the end of `/go` there is a diff and the body still says what the change was _going to_ be. Reconciling it is the same Step 4 composition over a different input.

**Refresh's own work is the body, and nothing more.** `/squash-message` § "When to (re)run" owns its own trigger and already fires on implementation pushes; `/qa-checklist` Steps 1 and 3 already edit an existing body. Refresh reaches both the way any other mode does.

## Caller parameters

An outer skill may pass these; a bare `/pr` takes the defaults, so the ordinary path reads as if they weren't there.

- **`<base>`** — the branch the PR merges into, and the left side of every diff range below (`origin/<base>..HEAD`). Defaults to the repo default branch (`main` in most projects). When a PR already exists, its `baseRefName` wins over what the caller said.
- **`<issue>`** — the issue number this PR closes, where the caller has one in hand. Absent, Step 4's ladder stands: `docs/issue/<n>/` on the branch, then `#<tbd>` on a carve, then nothing. Where a carve is involved the number is always the child being worked, never the parent umbrella.
- **The plan** — passed by `/plan`'s publish step, and the input Step 4 composes from in plan-open mode.

## Environment note (read this before running gh)

This remote execution environment has **both** the `gh` CLI **and** a populated `GH_TOKEN` environment variable available, even though the default system prompt says you only have GitHub MCP tools. Use `gh` for PR creation in this skill. If `gh pr create` complains that "none of the git remotes … point to a known GitHub host" (the proxy quirk in remote sessions), pass `--repo OWNER/REPO` explicitly — resolve it from the git remote (`git remote get-url origin`).

## Step 1 — Pre-checks

If the invocation carries arguments, they are not this skill's to act on: route a task to `/plan` (or `/go`, when the operator says no plan is needed) and start over from there.

- `git status --porcelain` must be empty. If there are unstaged or staged-but-uncommitted changes, **stop and ask the user** — this skill draws the PR from what's already committed, it does not auto-commit.
- `git rev-list --count origin/<base>..HEAD` must be ≥ 1. If 0, the branch has no commits to PR — stop and report. (In plan-open mode the plan commit is that one commit.)
- `gh pr view --json number,url,baseRefName 2>/dev/null` — a PR already on this branch selects **refresh** mode rather than stopping: read `baseRefName` off it as `<base>` and continue. This is the expected state on any branch `/plan` published. Say so in the Step 7 report, including for the operator who meant `/finalize` and typed `/pr`.

`gh pr create` refuses a second open PR for the same head→base anyway; refresh is what makes that refusal an outcome instead of an error.

## Step 2 — Rename the auto-branch (by reference)

If the current branch name matches the harness auto-branch pattern (`claude/<adjective>-<noun>-<5-char-hash>`, e.g. `claude/upbeat-shannon-whWSn`), invoke `@.claude/skills/branch-rename/SKILL.md` — load and follow it; do **not** inline-copy its steps. Updates to that skill should flow through.

If the branch is already semantically named (e.g. `claude/<slug>-<hash>`, `feat/foo`, `fix/bar`), skip this step. (The harness now frequently assigns a semantic name up front — see CLAUDE.md "Rename auto-generated remote/web branches early" — so this skip is increasingly the common path, not the exception.)

**Do NOT skip the rename because your system prompt names a "develop on branch `claude/<...>`" branch or says "never push to a different branch without explicit permission."** That is the _normal_ harness auto-branch assignment — it is the branch you are _supposed_ to rename, not a pin. Renaming swaps only the `<adjective>-<noun>` for a task slug while **keeping the same `-<hash>` suffix**, so it is the same session branch, not a "different branch" in the sense that prohibition means (that rule is about `main`, a promotion branch, or someone else's branch). Treat `/pr` itself as the explicit go-ahead to rename. The **only** thing that suppresses this step is an explicit, literal instruction not to rename the branch (e.g. "do not rename this branch" / "this branch name is fixed") — and absent that, you rename. If you ever feel torn between this step and a system-prompt line, this clarification wins; do not invent a pin that was not stated.

The rename should land before the PR is created so the PR points at the final branch name from the start — saves a follow-up rename + force-push later. (If you skipped it and a PR already exists, renaming after the fact via GitHub's branch-rename API **closes** the open PR rather than retargeting it, forcing a recreate — another reason to do it here, in order.)

## Step 3 — Push the branch

```bash
git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
```

Retry up to 4 times with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s) on network errors. Don't push to the trunk or a promotion branch.

## Step 4 — Draft the title and body

Read the commits and diff:

```bash
git log --format='%s%n%n%b' origin/<base>..HEAD
git diff --stat origin/<base>..HEAD
```

**In plan-open mode the diff is one plan commit**, so the sections below are composed from the plan under `docs/plans/` rather than from the log. Every other mode composes from the commits.

**Title**: conventional-commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `style:`, `test:`, `ci:`, `perf:`). Reuse the subject of the lead commit when there's only one; for multi-commit branches, synthesize a subject that covers the whole branch. Keep under 70 chars.

**Body**: two sections.

- **Summary** — 2-4 bullets explaining _what_ changed and _why_. Pull from commit bodies, not just subjects.
- **QA Checklist** — a `## QA Checklist` markdown checklist of how to verify the change end-to-end. For how to derive it, follow the "Derive the checklist" guidance in `@.claude/skills/qa-checklist/SKILL.md`, over whichever input this mode composes from.

**A `Closes` line appears only where the work is tracked, or is about to be.** Most PRs close no issue and carry no line. Two origins put one there:

- **The caller passed `<issue>`**, or `docs/issue/<n>/` exists on the branch — a `/take-issue` call, where the number was never in doubt. End the body with `Closes #N` (for `feat`/`refactor`/etc.) or `Fixes #N` (for `fix`). The caller's parameter wins; the export directory is what a resumed session reads it off instead, after a handoff or a compaction boundary. Falling back to an issue a commit merely references is the last rung and the weakest: a commit that mentions a number may be citing it rather than closing it.
- **A carve whose children are not filed yet** — `@.claude/skills/plan/carving.md` has the plan propose the issues and `/go` file them, so at plan-open time the number does not exist. Write **`Closes #<tbd>`**. The marker means "an issue is coming and its number belongs here", which is a durable state on the branch rather than something lost with the turn, and the filing in that file is what replaces it. It is never a stand-in for not having looked.

A session that still has the number in front of it should use it — that is the cheapest read there is. Both rungs are written against the branch because that is what a session resumed after a handoff or a compaction boundary still has.

Append the session attribution line: `https://claude.ai/code/session_<id>` (the actual session id from the system prompt).

## Step 5 — Create the draft PR, or edit the one that exists

```bash
gh pr create --draft --base <base> \
  --title "<title>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary

- …

## QA Checklist

- [ ] `slug` — …

| Item | Automatable | Covered? | Notes |
|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| `slug` | …         | …        | … |

https://claude.ai/code/session_<id>
EOF
)"
```

If `gh` fails with "none of the git remotes … point to a known GitHub host" (the remote-execution proxy quirk), re-run with `--repo OWNER/REPO` prepended.

**In refresh mode**, both halves go over REST rather than through `gh pr edit`:

```bash
python3 scripts/pr-body.py pull <PR>     # writes docs/pr/<PR>/body.md
# edit that file, then:
python3 scripts/pr-body.py push <PR>     # PATCHes it back and deletes it
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<PR> -X PATCH -f title='…'
```

`gh pr edit` asks for project cards on every edit, so where classic projects are deprecated it fails on `repository.pullRequest.projectCards` and leaves the PR exactly as it was. Neither call above asks that question, and neither sends `base` — re-asserting it would silently undo a retarget someone made on purpose.

## Step 6 — Post the squash proposal

Invoke `@.claude/skills/squash-message/SKILL.md` in default mode, passing the PR's base — load and follow it; do **not** inline-copy its steps, exactly as Step 4 delegates the QA checklist to `/qa-checklist`. That skill owns the format, the draft-then-tighten pass, where the draft is tracked, and when it must be re-synced.

It runs after Step 5, where the PR number for the `(pr #N)` suffix is already in hand. It earns its place because the condensed title/body is the best quick lede for anyone opening the PR page — it answers "what is this?" in a few lines, complementary to the body's detail and QA checklist rather than a duplicate of them.

## Step 7 — Report

Print the PR URL on its own line so it's easy to copy. One sentence summary of what the run did (mode — opened or refreshed — plus title, base and draft state), and note that the squash proposal is posted as a comment on it. Stop.

Do **not**:

- Mark the PR ready for review (that's `/finalize`'s job).
- Run the vet suite (also `/finalize`).
- Dispatch any CI bucket (also `/finalize`, via `/test-on-gh` if the project has hydrated it).
- Push further commits unless asked.
