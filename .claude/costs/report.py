"""Total the rows under `sessions/` — what the work in this repository would
have cost at Claude API rates.

Usage:
  python3 .claude/costs/report.py [--month YYYY-MM] [--json]

The totals are never written: they are derived from the rows, so the report is
run when a number is wanted rather than kept on disk going stale. A row still
carrying a retired field is rewritten without it, and the report says which.
`--json` prints the whole breakdown for whoever wants to keep one anyway. Rows
reach the trunk by merge, so a month read there is a month of *merged* work:
`CLAUDE.md` beside this file carries what that leaves out.

Stdlib only — Python 3.9+.
