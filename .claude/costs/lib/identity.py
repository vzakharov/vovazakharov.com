"""What a person recognises a session by, read out of its transcript.

Separate from the pricing beside it because none of it is arithmetic: these are
the records the file happens to carry that answer "which session was that", and
they change with the Claude Code version rather than with the rate table.

Each reader answers "is this record that kind, and what does it say" — `None`
for a record of another shape, never an error, since most records in the file
are of some other shape. `.claude/costs/CLAUDE.md` § "What names a session"
carries why a session needs standing in for at all.
