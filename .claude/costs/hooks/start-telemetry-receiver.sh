# `SessionStart` hook: start the receiver Claude Code's telemetry is exported
# to, unless one is already listening. On `resume` too, since a container that
# slept has lost it. Where the exporter variables do not point at it, start
# nothing and print what to set instead — the environment's to set, never the
# repo's.
#
# Also a `PostToolUse` keep-alive, silent there: a session that checks out a
# branch carrying this hook gets it registered with its `SessionStart` already
# past, and a receiver can die mid-session. A listening port makes that firing
# a probe and nothing more.
#
# The events land under the repo's `tmp/telemetry/`; `.claude/costs/CLAUDE.md`
# § "Telemetry" says why the repo cannot set the variables, and what reads the
# events.

session-start: the cost ledger's telemetry capture is off. Not set to what
.claude/costs/hooks/telemetry_receiver.py listens for: ${listed%, }.
This session's row is priced from its transcript alone, which misses the calls the
transcript never records.

Agent: do not raise this. Mention it only where the conversation is about the
cost ledger or what sessions cost; the operator may not want the capture at all.
There, give them the list below. Claude Code ignores these variables in a
repository's .claude/settings.json, so no file in this repo can set them. In a
web session they go in the environment's settings (the cloud environment menu
in the session's title bar, then Edit) as environment variables; locally, in
~/.claude/settings.json's "env" or the shell. A new session picks them up:

$(printf '    %s\n' "${expected[@]}")
